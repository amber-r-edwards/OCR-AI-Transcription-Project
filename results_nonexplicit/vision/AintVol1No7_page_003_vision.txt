Women Inspired

We received the following letter and statement from women in Seattle and we thank them for sharing their experience with us. We love them for their strength and beauty in moving as women to build a revolutionary movement which speaks to all the people. For refusing to shut up and "wait until after the Revolution," for reminding us again that any male-dominated revolution would simply reestablish oppression under another hand. So long as men, deplore the "moral" of Viet-nam and create conditions that encourage the rape of women (the objective fact, not just the glorious rhetoric) just to gain power over other people, they can only see attacking as appropriate for this. If only they claim to be the King.
We know from our own lives how little we have to lose because women have so little. We know how the oppressive men's movement gives lip service to women and dehumanizes us, ignores us and them. We thank these sisters as revolutionaries. All women who think of themselves as "in the movement" and all men who consider themselves "with their sisters' male chauvinism" should read this and support our sisters in Seattle.

Dear Sisters,
We are sending you this statement hoping that you will be able to print it in your next issue. We think it is important for women everywhere to know what happened to women in Seattle, to learn from it, and to let us know what to do for ourselves. We are in the process, as women, of defining our own power to create for ourselves the kind of revolutionary movement and society in which we want to live. We speak from our own experience, and hope that other women will be in touch with us about the similarities and differences in their own cities.
Because things have moved so fast, and we have taken out time writing this, some of you may be familiar with our statements. We think it is important that the facts be stated, and that our analysis be used by any woman who has read the article and finds nothing liberating in it.

GANG RAPE IN SEATTLE

The Seattle Liberation Front sponsored the Sky River Rock Festival. Three women were gang raped. One woman was stabbed at the festival. The rapists formed what was, in one man's own words, a "chauvin patrol."

Two days after Sky River, women from the women's liberation movement stood up as SLF general meetings. We denounced men who had fucked us over, beaten and destroyed people, and created a white, male supremacist movement in Seattle.

Three movements in Seattle, in many ways, dimension account of the event. The rock festival has been seen as the rock and roll majority still, brilliantly ambiguous. We denounced it not in any sense. All over the country has have affected women's lib. People who value feeling powerless to start the concert without getting up and helical. Many still clung to the rhetoric and the party to the explain out action and the history of class and black struggle. We've seen the most striking shift between the freedom of Berkeley, it up. With such head that it wasn't the SLF (after the from University of Washington, and said. His claims to radical honesty and liberty falls into his students. But he was not content with the historical. He sympathized with tormented and flamboyant victimization by U.S. private or hysterious white males who chose their own definition, he has former reversion. Kerr Sobey is the star to glamour and success to the media. The Berkeley Liberation Front which equates the movement encourages the individual "creative leader", and the women lead, companies, and was always the toughest. One men who had for a society in which all. Let's be revolution. They changed. 

In truth, we can say that the 1960's, composed of left critique, wanted to events. The truth of those acts, and moved us to see that even those who talked freedom survived and looked up to "respectability." The issue came up in a chauvinists' lingo--"masculinity's" threat, "femininity," the "revolutionary" obligation to speak up (but not act up). The white males ruled and received their righteous reward."

We are so angry at ourselves and keep on going in the movement. It think we have done wrong. When men at the general meeting, writing about ourselves as women, about the festival. We received a letter from Cornell's staff, and from the region to the women in those regions. The SLF men, so they weren't at the meeting. They came, and we had to have a meeting in Seattle. 

We told the SLF women about the abuse and began the first mass action against the rock festival--many who had written articles failed to relate to the movement as the struggle of women's liberation. The "hardcore" faction, directed by Greg's "defense committee," moved toward a direction of total refusal. 

We found out, and directed by the all-seeing, all-knowing, org of

the Sundance center. There was no time for us to find and defend what was important to us. The Chicago conspiracy trial was ending, and we failed to respond.

Racism was the next hard-and-crushing issue; we got our riot credentials, but while we talked about bailing black victims, white men called the police and started trashing and vandalizing. 

While, the festival that had large crowd attracted 75 people, and pushed its explanation in terms of "sex and freedom" truly meant rape and child molesting. "Liberation" for SLF, as it was then structured, based on the most chauvinist values. 

SLF men began watching the most outree women into the program and launched attacks on women who challenged their new identification. The festival men, the Police collectives, and other men supported and aided them. The men put out, uncolored leaflets and programs because they were less brutal, and attracted more "people." SLF collectives, when first formed, were half-women, half-men, but as SLF values began to seep through, the women' learned that all SLF collectives. If men refused to share what was produced and developed, what people wanted to have "allies of the movement", they usually found a slide toward the collective style, which SLF denied in the SLF. 

SLF handled shared as making out of. She became a "commando's" girlfriend. Usually, the only thing to do was to protest and refuse to cooperate. You could be silent, you could refuse, but it didn't make any difference. 

All these men failed to relate to our values. Although we believe that "balancing" is inevitable, we need to have new ways which relate to women and fight for liberation. The politics of "consciousness" and "liberation" is in all the niggling words which mean nothing to the folk who are exploited and used as things in the music scene or by organizing and spending thousands of dollars ingesting. It all starts here. 

Those who are involved in building the movement must be honest and relate to the women, not to the men exploiting people who have literally nothing to lose. 

We have else to do. About sexual breakthroughs, individual liberation, sexual revolution, or collective salvation, in theory, that's all, but the women's movement has returned to the sense of liberation, of true collective, truly revolutionary, truly democratic. We are, and for years, have been moving, removing, toward the women's movement. 

We already watched these things pretty light the game. Sundance had already divided us, the male-fucked-up and the men-in-heat. It established itself as much as the Chicago conspiracy and SLF, all sense of jargon, hook, and the media, and capital. 
But it was not until the Beach Tavern incident that we fully realized what happened. 

The incident: The men popular with the white bikers and the Sundance crowd showed an hour what SLF means and who it was. At the concert, three women at the Sky River Rock festival were gang raped. One women was stabbed rejecting a man's advances. The men announced they would form a "chauvin patrol" to rape and beat women. Men joined together to "fight" women who rejected them at least forty men, who were not only white, were directly involved as "chauvinist" patrol. They only people, the only victims, were women. They claimed, as all coverups, that nothing happened. "SLF" was the slogan alive and threatened the women. Our collective was reduced to silence. We learned. The victims argued that it was their right to go all the way, and that nothing could possibly have been stopped. Michael Lerner (look him up, he's on your side) dictated to stunned women, "Well, shit. You shouldn't have been raped." 

We want your thoughts and ideas of any conversation for the men. But the center finally dramatized it: Eighteen women liberation, liberation, male structures--and truly revolutionary
