Women Inspired

We received the following letter and statement from
women in Seattle and we thank them for sharing their
experience with us. We love them for their strength and
beauty in working as women to build a revolutionary
movement that speaks to all the people. For refusing
to shut up and "wait until after the Revolution," for
reminding us again that any male-dominated revolution
would simply re-institute oppression under another name.
So long as men, deplore the "rape of Vietnam" and
create conditions that encourage the rape of women
(the objective fact, not just the glorious rhetoric)
and so long as men power over other people, they can only see
stacking and corporate fronts, or all they claim to be
attacking.
We know from our own lives how little we have to
lose because women have so little. We know how the des-
perateness of women's lives and the exclusion of women
as revolutionaries, played on in Seattle, is the same
in all our cities. All women who think of themselves
as revolutionaries and all men who call themselves
"fighting with their male chauvinism" should read this and
support our sisters in Seattle.

Dear Sisters,

We are sending you this statement hoping that you will be
able to print it in your paper. We are writing it in
response to the events that have happened in Seattle
this summer. We feel that it is important for women
everywhere to know what has happened here, because it
is not an isolated incident. It is a reflection of the
male supremacy that exists in the movement and in the
society as a whole. We hope that women in other cities
will learn from our experience and will be able to
avoid some of the mistakes that we have made.
We are writing this statement because we feel that
the article on the Sky River Rock Festival, taken out
of context, is misleading. We are also writing it
because we are angry that no man has read the article
and finds nothing interesting in it.

GANG RAPE IN SEATTLE

The Seattle Liberation Front sponsored the Sky River Rock Fes-
tival. Three women were gang raped. One woman was stabbed at-
tempting to escape. The men who raped them were part of the
"chauvin patrol."
Two days after Sky River, women from the women's liberation
movement disrupted an SLF general meeting. We denounced
men who had fucked us over, raped and destroyed people, and
created a white, male supremacist movement in Seattle.
The movement in Seattle, in many ways, is an accurate account of the
movement across the country. We have been denounced as not
usually artful, brilliantly analyzing, and theoretical in
any sense. All over the country we have different "revolu-
tionary" groups that have built themselves at the expense of the
people who we feel responsible to, and for. The men in this
country can explain our action and the history of the movement
better than we can. We are sick and tired of hearing about
Berkeley, the 1968 sit-in, the Harvard strike. We came from
universities, we came from the Marxist Project at the
University of Washington, and we had classes to read Marx
and liberty halls into the students. But we have not created
a movement. We have created institutions and flamboyant
leaders. We have created the whitehouse and Berkeley and
the glamour of revolution. We have created Jerry Rubin to give
us glamour and access to the media. The Berkeley Liberation
Front was not successful because it was a movement of
people. It was successful because it was a movement of
well-educated men, who had money, connections, and who
called women. The men who were a part of the movement at Ber-
keley, took over the organization, and women were left
out.
The women in Seattle, who had been raped, and who had looked
to the movement for support, were told that they were
"paranoid." They were told that they were "hysterical."
They were told that they were "dividing the movement."
