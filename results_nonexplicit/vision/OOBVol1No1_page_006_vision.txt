gridiron protest
by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON: Women including WITCH will
protest male chauvinism at the Gridiron
Club dinner at the Statler-Hilton Hotel
on March 14.
Publicized as a "strictly white-
male affair," the dinner is given annu-
ally by the Gridiron Club, 50 of Wash-
ington's most prestigious male jour-
nalists. In this year's list of impor-
tant men, including President Nixon,
Vice-President Agnew and the Supreme
Court Justices.
Women in the press and in politi-
cs are not invited. For the most
part, press women take a sour grapes
attitude toward the affair. "We have
been covering Gridiron for the Wash-
ington Star. They're so deadly
boring."
Another woman journalist said she
agreed with the paper's policy of
not covering the dinner. "If we did,
we'd just be playing into the hands
of the male chauvinists. They'd say,
'Look, the women are so desperate
they'll even cover a dinner they
can't attend.'"
The Gridiron Club has been criti-
cized for its male-only policy for
years. But this year, women are
taking action. The protest is being
organized by WITCH, which has been
active in the Washington area for
the past year. WITCH is planning to
hold a similar protest in 10 more
places than the South.

women oppose
carswell
by Coletta Reid

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On January 28, Betty
Friedan, president of NOW (National
Organization for Women) testified in
opposition to Judge G. Harrold Carswell
as a nominee to the Supreme Court. She
was the first woman to testify against
a Supreme Court nominee on the basis of
sexism (sex discrimination).
On October 13, 1969, Judge Cars-
well voted to uphold Martin Marietta
Corporation which had refused to hire
Mrs. Ida Phillips because she had pre-
school age children.
The company denied sex discrimina-
tion although they did not refuse to
man with pre-school age children. Judge
Carswell supported the company and
agreed in his opinion with the company
that discrimination against women with
children is different than simple dis-
crimination against women. In 1965, a
bill was introduced to amend the Civil
Rights Act. Judge Carswell's position
on women discrimination is against those
who need jobs to support children or
work for their very survival.
Mrs. Friedan's personal experience
in the case of Mrs. Ida Phillips was
the basis for her attack on Carswell.
"Women must unite in strength to op-
pose the nomination of Judge Carswell
to the Supreme Court. We cannot allow
a man who discriminates against women
to be appointed to the highest court
in the land. We must fight for our
rights," said Mrs. Friedan.

HISTORICAL FIRST

Mrs. Phillips' fight for equality
is but one example of the many women
across the country who are seeking
justice. Women are demanding equal
rights and equal pay for equal work.
The fight for women's rights is a
fight for the rights of all people.
NOW's opposition to Carswell is
based on the fact that he opposed
women's rights. He is prejudiced
on the grounds of his case against
women. Mrs. Phillips' case is a
case where the need for a decision
in women's rights issues will preoccupy

the Supreme Court. In view of this
fact, the women of America cannot ac-
cept the appointment of a sexist judge
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

equal rights
amendment
by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON D.C.: Betty Friedan,
President of NOW (National Organi-
zation for Women) led a press con-
ference on February 10, on the
Equal Rights Amendment. Joined by
other women from Washington, Boston,
Pittsburgh and New York, the confer-
ence was held to announce the intro-
duction of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. The proposed 26th amendment pro-
vides that "equality of rights under
the law shall not be denied or abridg-
ed by the United States or by any
state on account of sex."
The bill is being introduced in
the Senate by Senator Birch Bayh
(D-Ind.) and in the House by Con-
gresswoman Martha Griffiths (D-
Mich.). The Equal Rights
Amendment, chaired by Congresswoman
Griffiths, is scheduled for hearings
in March.
Consistently, women have asked
for constitutional equality. "We
must have it," said Mrs. Friedan.
"We can't go on saying, 'we must
have some type of equality.' We
will not be satisfied until we
have full constitutional equality
for women."
Today is the 50th anniversary of the
19th Amendment, which allowed women
the right to vote. "We need a new
political power to get the amend-
ment. We don't want roses on Mother's
Day. We want our rights under the
Constitution."

women win
legal case

Last September women won a case
contesting the legality of state protec-
tions which have been used by some com-
panies to keep women off the job.
Palmer v. Thomson fired 24 women
who worked on a government contract
as proofreaders. The requirement for
35 pounds was given as a requirement
for the jobs. When the women filed
their complaint, the company claimed
that the state of Ohio had passed
a basis of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. The women won
the case. They were reinstated with
full back pay and all benefits.
Colgate-Palmolive lost a case in
1966. The court ruled that the com-
pany could not use a 35 pound weight
lift to demonstrate the physical ability to
perform the job. The court ruled that
if a woman can demonstrate her ability
to perform the job, she must be hired.

means of discrimination.
