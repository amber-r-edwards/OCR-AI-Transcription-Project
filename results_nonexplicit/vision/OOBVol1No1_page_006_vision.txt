gridiron protest

by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON: Women including WITCH will
protest male chauvinism at the Gridiron
Club dinner at the Statler-Hilton Hotel
on March 14.

Publicized as a "strictly white-
tie" affair, the dinner is given annu-
ally by the Gridiron Club, 50 of Wash-
ington's most prestigious male jour-
nalists. In this year's list of impor-
tant men, including President Nixon,
Vice-President Agnew and the Supreme
Court Justices.

Women in the press and in poli-
tics are not invited. For the most
part, press women take a sour grapes
attitude toward the affair. "Who needs
them anyway?" said the Washington
Morning Star. "They're so deadly
boring."

Another woman journalist said she
agreed with the paper but added, "If
only we could get rid of the sour
grapes feeling, we'd be satisfied."

WITCH is not satisfied. The group
plans to picket the dinner and to hold
a counter-dinner at the same time. The
counter-dinner will be open to all
women and men who are interested in
ending male chauvinism in the press.

The Gridiron protest is one of
many actions planned by WITCH to
protest male chauvinism in the press
and in the government. There will be
more actions in the future and in more
places than the South.

women oppose carswell

by Coletta Reid

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On January 28, Betty
Friedan, president of NOW (National
Organization for Women) testified in
opposition to Judge Carswell as a
Supreme Court nominee. She stated that
the appointment of Judge Carswell to
the Supreme Court would be a step
backward in the fight for equality of
the sexes (sex discrimination).

On October 13, 1969, Judge Cars-
well vetoed upholding Martin Marietta
Corporation which had refused to hire
Mrs. Ida Phillips because she had pre-
school age children.

The company defended sex discrimi-
nation although they did not discrimi-
nate with pre-school age children. Judge
Carswell supported the company and
agreed that discrimination against wo-
men with children was legal. Discrimi-
nation is different when simple dis-
crimination against sex is involved.
Phillips attacked Carswell's ruling as
a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. Judge Carswell is against those
who need discrimination against those
with children. 35 percent of working
women are mothers and depend on their
work for their very survival.

Mrs. Friedan's remarks were
backed by Mrs. Ida N. Phillips, a
secretary for Martin Marietta. "We
need to maintain our strength upon
the Supreme Court," she said. "We
need to maintain our strength for
those who are discriminated against
because of their sex and their chil-
dren," said Mrs. Friedan.

HISTORICAL FIRST

Mrs. Phillips' fight for equality
is but one example of the many women
across the country who are seeking
legal redress for sex discrimination.
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear
the case of Mrs. Phillips. The case
will be the first sex discrimination
case to be heard by the Supreme Court.

NOW's opposition to Carswell is
based upon the fact that a case
which involves Mrs. Phillips is pending
on the grounds of her case against
women. The Supreme Court's decision
on the case of Mrs. Phillips could be
one of the most important cases in
women's rights issues will preoccupy

the Supreme Court. In view of this
fact, the women of America cannot ac-
cept the appointment of a sexist judge
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

equal rights amendment

by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON D.C.: Betty Friedan,
President of NOW (National Organi-
zation for Women) led a press con-
ference on February 10, 1970, in
support of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. Women from New York, Boston,
Pittsburgh and Washington joined
Friedan in demanding action on the
bill. The proposed 26th amendment pro-
vides that "equality of rights under
the law shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any state
on account of sex." The amendment
was first introduced in 1923 by the
National Women's Party. It has been
reintroduced in every session of
Congress since then. The amendment
has been endorsed by the National
Federation of Business and Professional
Women, the National Federation of
Republican Women, the National Federa-
tion of Democratic Women, and the
American Association of University
Women.

For constitutional equality for
women, Friedan said, "We must not
wait for men to give us our rights.
We must come together, organize and
demand our rights. We must not wait
for men to give us our rights. We
will win our constitutional equality
for women."

Today is the 50th anniversary of the
19th Amendment, NOW, and the League
of Women Voters, will be active in
political power to get the amendment
passed. "We don't want roses on Mother's
Day. We want our rights under the
Constitution."

women win legal case

Last September women won a case
contesting the legality of state protec-
tions which have been used by some com-
panies to keep women off the job. The
panel of 3 women fired 2 factory
workers when they reached the age of
35 provided she was a requirement for
her job. When one woman reached the
age of 35, she was fired. The panel
of 3 women filed a complaint under
Title 45 of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. The panel found
that the company had discriminated
against the women and ordered the
Colgate-Palmolive Company to reinstate
the women with full pay.
