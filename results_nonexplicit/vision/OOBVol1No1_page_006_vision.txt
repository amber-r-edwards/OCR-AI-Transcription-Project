gridiron protest
by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON: Women including WITCH will
protest male chauvinism at the Gridiron
Club dinner at the Statler-Hilton Hotel
on March 14.

Publicized as a "strictly white-tie"
affair the dinner is given annu-
ally by the Gridiron Club, 50 of Wash-
ington's most prestigious male jour-
nalists, for this year's list of Impor-
tant Men including President Nixon,
Vice-President Agnew and the Supreme
Court justices.

Women in the press and in poli-
tics are not invited. For the most
part, press women take a sour grapes
attitude toward the affair. "Who needs
them anyway?" said a reporter for the
Washington Star. "They're so deadly
boring."

Another woman journalist said she
agreed with the protest but could not
picket. "I'd lose my job," she said.
"My boss is president of the Gridiron
Club."

One Club member derided the pro-
test by saying that women are not be-
ing discriminated against since wives
and girlfriends are invited to a recep-
tion the following day.

Separate but equal seems to be
pulsed by the so-called VIP's in more
places than the South.

women oppose
carswell
by Coletta Reid

WASHINGTON, D.C. On January 28, Betty
Friedan, president of NOW (National
Organization for Women) testified in
Senate Hearings against Supreme Court
nominee G. Harold Carswell for his
sexism (sex discrimination).

On October 13, 1969, Judge Cars-
well voted to uphold Martin Marietta
Corporation which had refused to hire
Mrs. Ida Phillips because she had pre-
school age children.

The company denied sex discrimi-
nation although it said it would hire a
man with pre-school age children. Judge
Carswell supported an opinion that
advanced the doctrine of "sex plus"—
that discrimination against a woman with
children is different than simple dis-
crimination against women and is not
barred under Title 7 of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. Judge Carswell's ruling
will allow discrimination against those
who need jobs most. Over 85 percent of
working mothers of pre-school children
work for their very survival.

Later, in New York, other women
joined Mrs. Friedan in a press conference
to denounce Carswell and call upon women
to use their political strength to de-
feat his nomination. "Women must inform
their senators that they confirm an
enemy of women, who would make it im-
possible for women to have both children
and jobs, we will work for their defeat,"
said Mrs. Friedan.

HISTORICAL FIRST

Mrs. Phillips' fight for equality
is but one example of the many women
across the country who are growing
increasingly aware of their status as
second-class citizens. This growing
awareness is expressed in women's wil-
lingness to take political action to
secure their rights.

NOW's opposition to Carswell is
the first time in history that a Su-
preme Court nominee has been opposed
on the grounds of his prejudice against
women. Mrs. Phillips' case is being
appealed to the Supreme Court—a
harbinger of the next decade in which
women's rights issues will preoccupy
the Supreme Court. In view of this
fact, the women of America cannot ac-
cept the appointment of a sexist judge
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

equal rights
amendment
by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON D.C. Betty Friedan,
President of NOW (National Organi-
zation of Women) led a press confer-
ence on February 17. One hun-
dred women from New York, Boston,
Pittsburgh and Washington joined
with her to demand Senate action on
the Equal Rights for Women Amendment
to the Constitution.

The proposed 26th amendment pro-
vides that "Equality of rights under
the law shall not be denied or abridg-
ed by the United States or by any
State on account of sex."

The amendment was first intro-
duced in 1923 by the National Women's
Party, but has been "in committee"
for 47 years. Presidently sponsored
by 70 senators, it is still before the
Senate Subcommittee for Constitutional
Amendments, chaired by Senator Birch
Bayh.

Mrs. Friedan said women's demands
for constitutional rights are particu-
larly timely considering the recent con-
frontation of sexist Judge Harold Cars-
well to the Supreme Court. "That
shows we can't rely on the whims of
prejudiced male judges," she said.
"We must have constitutional protec-
tion. Our majority is in the 1970's
will be for constitutional equality
for women.

"It's been a long, long struggle.
Today is the 50th anniversary of the
19th Amendment. Now, and better late
than never, we will unite to use our
political power to defeat the enemies.

"Do what I want you to do! Mothers
Day. We want our rights under the
Constitution.

the Equal Rights Amendment Press
Conference

In view of the dis-
crimination against
women's wages and
employment in general,
the amendment should
be strengthened to re-
quire affirmative action
to eliminate discrimi-
natory practices and to
provide for enforceable
remedies.

women win
legal case

Last September women won a case
contesting the legality of state protec-
tion laws which have been used by em-
ployers to keep women in low-paying jobs.

Three women were fired by Colgate-
Palmolive on the grounds that the law
permitted women from lifting more than
35 pounds which was a requirement for
their jobs. The women were replaced
by men. The women first took their
case, then went on to win an appeal on
the basis of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits dis-
crimination in employment based on sex.

The Court further declared that
Colgate "must notify all of its workers
each of them who desires to do so,
be afforded a reasonable opportuni-
ty to demonstrate his or her ability to
perform more strenuous jobs on a regular
basis. Each employee who is able to so
demonstrate must be permitted to bid on
and fill any position to which his or
her seniority may entitle him or her."
Jobs that were previously reserved
for men at the Indiana plant were paid
at wage rates which began at the highest
rate payable for jobs open to women.
The effect of the Court's ruling is to
give women equal opportunity to bid for
better paying jobs on the basis of their
individual capabilities and to prohibit
their exclusion from these Jobs because
of sex. The ruling is a victory for the
Colgate women workers, for the volunteer
women workers from Human Rights for
Women, Inc. in Washington, D.C. who rep-
resented them, and for all women in in-
dustrial jobs.

witch
by Anne Hutchinson

WASHINGTON: Today, February 27, WITCH's
described upon the Panel on Population
Control of the International Develop-
ment Conference sponsored by the govern-
agencies and U.S. corporations "active"
in the Third World.

Turning a speech by Sen. Ralph Yar-
borough of Texas, WITCH'S rose from the
audience chanting, "We are witches"
"we have to come to yell! You palu-
tin experts! Can all 90 to hell - You
think you can cure? All the world's
ills? By forcing poor people? To
take our unhealthy pills."

The stunned audience watched as
WITCH's portrayed Pres. Nixon answer-
ing the cries of the poor women of the
world for free food, free housing free
health care, free land, and freedom.
He beat them back with birth control
pills and physical blows.

The WITCH'S then brewed the final
contraceptive: the one for the white male
establishment. They chanted, "Now it
is time to control the white western
male," as beer, powder puffs, and other
pacifiers of women were tossed into a
cauldron.

After a brief skirmish with Sen.
Yarborough and the chairman of the AID
Birth Control Program, the microphone
was seized by the WITCH'S, the brew was
passed around to the men in the audi-
ence, and leaflets were distributed de-
nouncing population control rather
than the redistribution of resources.
