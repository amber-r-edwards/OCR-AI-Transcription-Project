gridiron protest
by Rachel Scott

WASHINGTON: Women including WITCH will
protest male chauvinism at the Gridiron
Club dinner at the Statler-Hilton Hotel
on March 14.
Publicized as a "strictly white-
male affair," the dinner is given annu-
ally by the Gridiron Club, 50 of Wash-
ington's most prestigious male jour-
nalists. In this year's list of impor-
tant men, including President Nixon,
Vice-President Agnew and the Supreme
Court Justices.
Women in the press and in politi-
cs are not invited. For the most
part, press women take a sour grapes
attitude toward the affair. "Who needs
that cheap song and routine," says the
Washington Star. "They're so deadly
boring."
Another woman journalist said she
agreed with the Star but would have
picked up a free ticket if she could.
"Of course, I would have gone," she
said. "It's the only way to get the
news. It's a good chance to meet the
people you write about."
The Gridiron Club is not the only
male chauvinist organization in Wash-
ington. The National Press Club, the
National Press Photographers Associa-
tion and the White House News Photog-
raphers Association are all male.
Women are beginning to be more
vocal about the discrimination in
places than the South.

women oppose
carswell
by Coletta Reid

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On January 28, Betty
Friedan, president of NOW (National
Organization for Women) testified in
opposition to Judge G. Harrold Carswell
as a nominee for the Supreme Court.
She said, "We oppose Judge Carswell
because of his record of opposition to
sexism (sex discrimination)."
On October 13, 1969, Judge Cars-
well voted to uphold Martin Marietta
Corporation which had refused to hire
Mrs. Ida Phillips because she had pre-
school age children.
The company denied sex discrimina-
tion although they said they would hire
a man with pre-school age children. Judge
Carswell supported the company and said
that discrimination against a woman with
children is different than simple dis-
crimination against women. In 1965, a
brief was filed against the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. Judge Carswell's position
in the 1965 discrimination suit was not
only wrong, it was also against the
needs of millions of American women who
work for their very survival.
Mrs. Friedan's personal experience
in the case of Mrs. Ida Phillips was
that "the potential strength of women
to become a political force in this
country is enormous. We can no longer
be treated as second class citizens.
We will not be discriminated against
because we are women, because we are
mothers," said Mrs. Friedan.
