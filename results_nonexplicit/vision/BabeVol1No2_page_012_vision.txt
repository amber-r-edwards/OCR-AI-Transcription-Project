About two years ago women in the radical movement all over the country
began to meet together weekly in small groups to discuss our common
problems. We talked about sex, about the man in our lives, about our
childhoods, our schooling, our families. Our stories were remarkably
similar. Differing backgrounds or experience meant that we were all
thought to be a personal problem, the result of our own particular
situation, was common to everyone. We realized that we had all been
suffering from the damage society inflicts on an oppressed group. We
were feeling the results of being a woman in a society designed by and
for men.
  Today we are still an embryo movement with no settled structure or
direction. Small groups remain our basic organizational unit. Bost women
see this as the most effective means of creating consciousness -- the
process of discovering more and more about the dynamics of women's
oppression. However, these discoveries in and of themselves do not
liberate women. We have learned that real institutions in this society are
responsible for our oppression. Thus we are a political movement seeking
to transform social institutions. We are still in the process of
developing our political analysis and defining the political projects we
will undertake. Today, we are only beginning.

The Telegraph Cinema is showing
"The Miracle Worker" Feb. 5-11.
This is the story of Helen Keller
who may people don't know was a
socialist. "College isn't the place
to go for ideas," "I don't give a
damn about sex radicals," "The wise
fools who still in the high places
fail to see that in revolutionary
times real issues are not settled
by statutes, clauses and authorities,
but in the spirit of the people"
is one of the theatre where they are
showing "The Philadelphia Story"
with which Katherine Hepburn plays the
slave-driven to absolute perfection.
The total lack of choice of a male/
wife for daughters of the ruling
class is abundantly clear in this.

FEMALE LIBERATION ALMANAC
Feb. 3, 1965, Every now and then
we should recall Emma Hatchins, who
on Feb. 3, 1965 (then a 19 year old
student at U.C. Berkeley became the
first woman to ride on the outside
steps of an S.F. cable car.) "This is
the ridiculous," is what she said to the
harassed Muni Railways official who
tried to make her step inside. As
Muni's hutchins stubbornly held her
ground and her grip, the embarrassed
offical discovered that the "law"
against women riding, on the outsides
was not only unwritten but non-existent.
(from Herb Caplan)
What he didn't tell us is that
Hanna Hutchins was one of the three
women on the steering committee
of the S.P. Free Speech Movement the
previous year.
Feb. 15, 1820, Susan B. Anthony
was born. The motto of her paper,
which she put out together with Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton, called "Revolu-
tion," was "Men, their rights and
nothing more; women, their rights
and nothing less." by Laura X
