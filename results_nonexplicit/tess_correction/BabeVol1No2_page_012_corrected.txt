Feb. 3,1965, Every now and then
we should: recall Mona Hutchins, who
on Feb. 3, 1965 (then a 19 year old
student at U.C.Berkeley) became the
first woman to ride on the outside
“steps of an S.F. cable car. "This is
ridiculous," is all she said to the
hasseled Muni Railway official who
tryed to make her step inside. As
Miss Hutchins 8tubbornly held her
ground and her grip, the embarrassed
‘official discovered that the "law"
against women riding on the outside
was not only unwritten but non-exix-
tant.

(from Herb Caen)

What he didn't tell us is that
Mona Hutchins was one of the three
women on the steering committee

of the Free Speech Movement the
previous year.

FOI An

About two years ago women in the radical movement all over the country
‘began to meet together weekly in small groups to discuss our common
problems. We talked about sex, about the men in our lives, about our
childhoods, our schooling, our families. Our stories were remarkably
similar. Definite patterns of experience emerged. What we had all -
thought to be a personal problem, the result of our own particular
situation, was common to everyone. We realized that we had all been
suffering from the damage society inflicts on an oppressed group. We
were feeling the results of being a woman in a society designed by and
for men.

Today we are still an embryo movement with no settled structure or
direction. Small groups remain our basic organizational unit. Most women
see this as the most effective means of "raising consciousness" -- the
process of discovering more and more about the dynamics of women's
oppression. However, these discoveries in and of themselves do not 1lib-
erate women. We have learned that real institutions in this society are
responsible for our oppression. Thus we are a political movement seeking
to transform social institutions. We are still in the process of dev-
eloping our political analysis and defining the political projects we
will undertake. Today, we are only beginning

“Feb. 15, 1820, Susan B.Anthony

was born. The motto of her paper,
which she put out together with Eliz-

nothing more; women, their rights
and nothing less."
