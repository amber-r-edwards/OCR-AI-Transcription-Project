Drugs are here to stay.

History bears this out. Certainly most of you will agree
that recreational drug use will not spontaneously disappear, at
least not in the foreseeable future. The use of marijuana, hash-
ish, cocaine, and opium, to name a few drugs, has persisted in
various parts of the world for centuries.

The only way that drugs might conceivably disappear from the
scene is as a result of enforced prohibition by the government.
Again, history teaches the lesson, which government authorities
ought to have learned by this time, that enforced prohibition
only creates criminals by driving drug traffic underground.

REZAKING AWAKENING

Dope Summit Conference

By Judy Mitchell

BUFFALO, N. Y. — Minds were
sharpened in Buffalo on the sub-
jects of marijuana — medical,
social and legal significance — at
a "Dope Summit Conference"
last week. The drug experts
from around N. Y. State, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania were
joined by delegates from Cal-
ifornia, Massachusetts, and
Ohio. The panelists included
Dr. Robert [illegible], Deputy
Commissioner of the N. Y. State
Health Department; Dr. Milton
[illegible]; Dr. Anna Caplan;
Dr. Samuel [illegible]; attorney
Michael F. [illegible]; and Mrs.
Lois Fletcher and other local
activists.

After two days of sessions in
which a list of issues agreed that
the biggest problem with drugs is
the stigma they carry and the bad
medical, legal and social image
of users, the two top priorities
now seem to be the passage of
laws to eliminate penalties for the
possession of small amounts of
marijuana and the education of the
public as to the facts about dope.

The conference concluded with
the adoption of a resolution call-
ing for the repeal of the mari-
juana prohibition and urging that
marijuana be treated as a medical
and social problem rather than
a criminal one. The resolution
also called for further studies on
the medical aspects of marijuana.

Also present were representa-
tives of student bodies and civil
liberties groups. Several mem-
bers of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
attended. The conference heard
repeated testimony that mari-
juana was far less harmful than
alcohol and tobacco, and that
prohibition did more harm than
the drug itself.

Many of the papers presented
were technical in nature and
dealt with the effects of THC,
the principal active ingredient
in marijuana, and other psycho-
active substances. A number of
speakers emphasized the possible
benefits of marihuana in medicine,
and reported that some physi-
cians had found it useful in the
treatment of glaucoma, severe
nausea in cancer patients, and
as an appetite stimulant.

There was also general agree-
ment that the singularly unfunda-
mental approach of criminalizing
users had resulted in more social
damage than the drug itself.
The conference adopted a plan
for continued coordination be-
tween the various groups and for
a publicity campaign to educate
the public.

Dr. [illegible], professor, [illegible]
and neuro-abounded at a series of
meetings at which many aspect
of psychedelic drugs were dis-
cussed. (Psychedelic drugs were
first classified as LSD type drugs.)
A committee of [illegible] was
impaneled to study the entire
problem. Dr. [illegible] was ap-
pointed to work with the legisla-
tive committee to prepare new
laws governing drug use.

[illegible] who said he was con-
cerned that the real solution lay
in education rather than penali-
zation urged that [illegible] and
social programs be initiated.

[illegible] added that the de-
stabilizing effects of the drug on
the psyche are usually over-
stated and that the majority of
users do not become [illegible].
He urged the public to [illegible].

Many attendees said they felt
that the conference had been one
of the most important gatherings
on the subject in recent years and
that the recommendations would
be carried to other centers.
